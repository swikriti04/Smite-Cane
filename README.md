# Smite-Cane

## ❓ Problem Statement

Without vision, can you imagine how challenging it would be for a visually impaired person to navigate through the pathway without bumping into obstacles?
Even if you use a normal white cane there might be chances that you could fall or your cane gets stuck somewhere in the hurdle.
The problems that visually impaired people face includes:
* Detecting hurdles
* Finding Path
* Hit with speeding object

## 😎 Solution

* Giving them a new vision and environment to visually impaired people. 

Smite Cane (Smart White Cane) provides the blind people or visually impaired people, a hearable environment that focuses on the field of assistive devices.
It converts visual data by image processing into an auditory modality that will assist the user with a robotic vision through speech.
It contains: 
* A Raspberry Pi 
* A Motor
* A Pi camera or a webcam and 
* An artificial intelligence module.

On pressing the button on the cane, the camera module will start taking real-time video stream and analyze it using the Caffe Model(Artificial Intelligence Module using OpenCV) to detect the object/person, and then using a speaker or headphone, the cane will voice assist the person about the environment. 
Also, we are attaching a motor for vibrations so that the detected object will be translated into Morse code since visually impaired people are already trained about it and the vibrations in the motor will be according to the frequency of Morse code. This feature will not only help the blind but also the deaf people about the environment and guide through the path.

## ✅ Scalability

Most of the visually impaired people are aged 50 years and above. The burden of visual impairment in India is estimated at 62 million; of these, 54 million persons have low vision, and 8 million are blind.
